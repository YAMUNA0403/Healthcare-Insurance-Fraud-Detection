🛡️ Healthcare Insurance Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
This project is aimed at building an intelligent and scalable system to detect fraudulent healthcare insurance claims using advanced machine learning techniques. It automates fraud identification, improves detection accuracy, and minimizes false positives in a real-world insurance claim dataset.

📌 Project Overview
Fraudulent healthcare insurance claims lead to massive financial losses and reduced trust in the healthcare system. Traditional detection methods (manual auditing, rule-based systems) are time-consuming and ineffective against complex fraud patterns. This project leverages CatBoost and Isolation Forest models to detect fraud in claims data accurately and efficiently.

🎯 Objectives
<ul>
<li>Identify fraudulent health insurance claims using ML-based predictive models.</li>

<li>Minimize false positives and false negatives to avoid rejecting valid claims.</li>

<li>Automate the fraud detection pipeline to reduce manual effort.</li>

<li>Improve efficiency in claim processing and risk assessment.</li>
  
</ul>


🗂️ Dataset
The dataset includes:
<ul>

<li>Patient & Member Info: name, age, gender, location, employment, relationship.</li>

Claim Details: cause of treatment, fee charged, number of dependents, membership duration.</li>

Label: Indicates whether a claim is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).</li>
</ul>
